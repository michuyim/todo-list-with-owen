# My Team To-Do List Project

This is a to-do list app by me and my partner Owen Adele. Owen follow these steps to make sure this project works as properly on your computer. If you encounter any challenges you can reach out to me.

I need you to design the frontend part of this project. Specifically css because you arent familiar with jsx yet. I will help with connecting the frontend to the server, that means i will continue to make frequent additions and changes to this repo.

## Here's what you'll need to do get started

1. Download this repo or clone it to your conputer by typing this command in your termninal/command shell `` git clone repo https://github.com/michuyim/todo-list-with-owen.git ``
2. `` cd todo-list-with-owen ``
3. `` npm install ``
4. `` npm run dev ``

If you encounter any errors please let me know.

## Requirements

1. Node
2. npm
3. git (optional)

This is a very crappy instruction and its ok if you are unable to understand what I'm saying. Just Hit mme up on whatsapp and i'll help you out.

## N/B: If you want to use a CSS Library please use Bootstrap, Its what i am familiar with for now
